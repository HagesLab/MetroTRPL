p$ Measurement handling flags:
# Truncate measurements to only those within this time range. Inf values indicate an unbounded range. 
Time cutoffs: 0	2000
# Which measurements in a sequence to keep for MCMC. A list such as [0,2] means to keep only the first and third measurements,
# while omitting the second and others. None means ALL measurements are kept. 
Select measurement: None
##
p$ MCMC Control flags:
# How many samples to propose.
Num iters: 8000
# Which solver engine to use - solveivp (more robust) or odeint (sometimes faster).
Solver name: solveivp
# Annealing schedule parameters.
# (Starting model uncertainty, steprate, final model uncertainty)
# Will drop one order of magnitude per STEPRATE samples until FINAL is reached.
Annealing Controls: (500, 200000, 0.01)
# Ratio to maintain betwen Model uncertainty and proposal variance.
# Model uncertainty will be taken as this times proposal variance.
Likelihood-to-variance: 500
# Compare log of measurements and simulations for purpose of likelihood evaluation. Recommended to be 1 or True. 
Use log of measurements: 1
# Normalize all individual measurements and simulations to maximum of 1 before likelihood evaluation. 
# A global scaling coefficient named 'm' may optionally be defined in param_info. 
# If the absolute units or efficiency of the measurement is unknown, 
# it is recommended to try fitting 'm' instead of relying on normalization. 
Normalize all meas and sims: 0
# Proposal function used to generate new states. Box for joint uniform box and Gauss for multivariate Gaussian. 
Proposal function: box
# Whether to coerce params to stay within the bounds listed in metropolis.check_approved_param(). 
# =1 will coerce while =0 will only warn.
Use hard boundaries: 1
# Whether a proposed move should change in one param or all params at once.
Propose params one-at-a-time: 0
# Directory checkpoint files stored in.
