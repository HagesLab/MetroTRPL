p$ Measurement handling flags:
# Truncate measurements to only those within this time range. Inf values indicate an unbounded range. 
Time cutoffs: 0	2000
# Which measurements in a sequence to keep for MCMC. A list such as [0,2] means to keep only the first and third measurements,
# while omitting the second and others. None means ALL measurements are kept. 
Select measurement: 0	2	4

p$ MCMC Control flags:
# How many samples to propose.
Num iters: 50
# Which solver engine to use - solveivp (more robust) or odeint (sometimes faster).
Solver name: solveivp
# Annealing schedule parameters.
# (Starting model uncertainty, steprate, final model uncertainty)
# Will drop one order of magnitude per STEPRATE samples until FINAL is reached.
Annealing Controls: (10.0, 200000, 0.01)
# Ratio to maintain betwen Model uncertainty and proposal variance.
# Model uncertainty will be taken as this times proposal variance.
Likelihood-to-variance: 500
# Compare log of measurements and simulations for purpose of likelihood evaluation. Recommended to be 1 or True. 
Use log of measurements: 1
# Normalize all individual measurements and simulations to maximum of 1 before likelihood evaluation. 
# Global scaling coefficients named '_s#' may optionally be defined in MCMC_fields by 
# enabling the scale_factor setting. 
# If the absolute units or efficiency of the measurement is unknown, 
# it is recommended to try fitting '_s' instead of relying on normalization. 
# Enabling this will disable _s for the selected measurements. 
Normalize these meas and sim types: None
# Add additional scale factors that MMC will attempt to apply on the simulations 
# to better fit measurement data curves. 
# Must be None, or a list/tuple of three elements: 
# First element "global", which will add a single scaling factor "_s" shared by all curves, 
# or "ind", which will add independent scaling factors "_s0", "_s1", "_s2", ... for each curve. 
# Second element an initial guess. 1 means no scaling is applied.
# Third element an initial variance, similar to the initial_variance parameter for other parameters.
# All scale factors will get the same initial guess and variance. 
Scale factor: ind	100	0.02
# Proposal function used to generate new states. Box for joint uniform box and Gauss for multivariate Gaussian. 
Proposal function: box
# Whether to coerce params to stay within the bounds listed in metropolis.check_approved_param(). 
# =1 will coerce while =0 will only warn.
Use hard boundaries: 1
