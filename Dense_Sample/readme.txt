This directory contains a version of the dense sampling algorithm from our repository Bayesian-Inference-TRPL,
modified to be controllable by script files generated by MCMC_script_writer.py.

The usage is the same as the main Metropolis sampling program - first run MCMC_script_writer.py to generate
a script file, and then run run_dense_sampler.py. The outputs are .npy files containing the parameter values
and likelihoods for each sample.

However, the following options are treated differently by the dense sampler:
1. param_info["prior_dist"] now acts as hard boundaries within which the space will be randomly sampled.
2. param_info["init_guess"] specifies default values for specific boundaries.
3. param_info["active"] specifies whether parameters will be randomly sampled, or whether they will be fixed
  to defaults set by param_info["init_guess"].
4. MCMC_fields["num_iters"] determines how many dense samples will be taken.
5. The first argument in MCMC_fields["scale_factor"] and similar options that add curve-specific inferrable parameters
  will determine the sampling spread for these parameters. For example, if the initial guess for scale_factor is 1
  and the first argument is 100, scale_factor will be sampled from 0.01 to 100.
6. param_info["init_variance"], and the settings "likel2variance_ratio", "self_normalize", "fittable_fluences",
  "fittable_absps", "proposal_function", "one_param_at_a_time", "hard_bounds", and all checkpoint settings
  in MCMC_fields are ignored.
